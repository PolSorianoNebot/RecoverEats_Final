## **Description**
Recover Eats is a health-monitoring web application that connects WHOOP fitness
data with tailored meal recommendations. By integrating recovery metrics, workout
data, sleep tracking, and nutritional APIs, Recover Eats provides users with
personalized diet suggestions that align with their physical condition and fitness
goals.

### Business Solution
In the growing health and fitness market, individuals use wearables like WHOOP to
monitor sleep, recovery, heart rate, and strain. However, this raw data is often
underutilized, lacking actionable feedback especially in nutrition.

#### Recover Eats bridges this gap by:
- Interpreting WHOOP metrics to provide tailored dietary advice.
- Encouraging data-driven meal planning.
- Delivering recipe suggestions and ingredients via email for easy action.
- Supporting fitness goals such as bulking, cutting, or maintaining.
- “Bridging the Gap Between Fitness Recovery and Personalized Nutrition.”

### App Features
Intelligent meal suggestions based on recovery score and workout intensity.
